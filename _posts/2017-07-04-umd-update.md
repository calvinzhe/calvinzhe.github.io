Today, my TerpConnect account has been set up, allowing me to have my own personal website in the University of Maryland directory.  I decided to have it redirect it to my github pages website, just so I don't have so many websites scattered over the internet.

I also updated this website to remove unused placeholder menu links, add an introduction to the home page and a few [Physics Animations](/physics_animations/index.html) I've made using Python.

The time for me to say goodbye to Los Angeles and depart for Maryland is getting close.  I have rough idea of what my next 6 years is going to be like, but I won't really know until I get there.  I do intend to make the most out of it.  I am certainly going to miss LA, the place I grew up and lived in almost all of my life, but I will be looking forward to the opportunities that will available in the East Coast.
