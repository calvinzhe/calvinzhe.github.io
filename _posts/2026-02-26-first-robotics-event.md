An advertisement call for First Robotics volunteers showed up in my work e-mail inbox.  I had moved to San Antonio eight months ago but did not spend very much time going out.  The few  notable activities were going to the River Walk, the Alamo, the Natural Caverns, and Turkey Trot 5K.  Other than that, I've been mostly a homebody - I had purchased a new house after all, and am quite content just staying indoors.  But having worked in robotics in the Machine Complex startup, and having heard of First Robotics numerous times during that period of my life, this was an event that I felt like I had to attend.

Now that I have been working a 9-5 in the military and am a homeowner, I've found it difficult to find the spare time and motivation to work on robotics.  Part of it may just have to do with me wanting to save up the funds to buy parts.  After all, the Raspberry Pi 3B that I am using takes minutes to boot up, drastically slowing the developmental process.  I've also found the task of building a power distribution system daunting - to appropriately isolate power going to the controller, wheels, and (for a future implementation) robot arm, all while keeping the system simple, namely powered with a single battery.  I also have other unfinished projects, like a laser optics bench,  a 3D printed flight stick, and an action camera gimbal.  Attending an event like this would at least keep me in the loop and perhaps give me ideas and inspiration.

The event I volunteered for was called a First Tech Challenge (FTC for short), which is just a step below the First Robotics' flagship event, the First Robotics Competition (FRC), the major leagues.  I would be a judge, and the contestants were teams of high school and some middle school students showcasing their robots.
