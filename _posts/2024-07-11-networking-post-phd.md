It has been many years since I've written a post in this blog.  You could say I experienced some setbacks in my PhD career that I didn't feel proud of
and lost the desire to write and post about it.  Now that I have graduated, have more time on my hands, and have the freedom and responsibility to mold the career ahead of me, 
I feel that it might be valuable to make updates to my personal website.

This blog serves to journal my experiences which might hopefully be of benefit
to the reader and allow them to better get to know me, but it is at the very least something for me to look back on.  I suppose I could write updates
on social media, but I don't exactly like the idea of spamming posts onto other people's feeds which they are not genuinely interested in or writing
out of an urgency to get views and engagement.

About 7 years ago, which was around the time I had recently graduated from UCLA and was looking for employment, I wrote a blog post about my experiences at the
LA Tech Fair.  Now, I am on a similar boat - I've recently graduated again with a PhD and am looking for employment, to build a career / business.  Quite like
my experience after I finished my bachelors, finding a job has been very difficult, much to my disappointment after being told by many people that I ought to
have a lot of opportunity for me given that I've completed a PhD.  It could very well just be the nature of the job search and that a science degree
is not all that relevant to the job market unless you are choosing to pursue a career in research - and for PhD graduates, a career closely related to your
thesis topic.  It could also be an unfavorable job market, as evidenced by the recent mass layoffs in the tech sector.

Rather than continuing straight down a research and academic career, I wanted to broaden my horizon, consider working in industry, and explore an area I had
been curious about called entrepreneurship.  Quite frankly, I wanted a break for my mind from thinking about ultraintense laser physics research all the time,
and from writing manuscripts and the tedious editing and publishing process.  This brings us to the topic of this blog post, which is about my experiences at
several memorable conferences / events related to my career development.

#### SPIE Photonics West and AR | VR | MR Conference 2023

In February of 2023, during the final semester of my PhD tenure, I decided to attend Photonics West as suggested by an Amplitude Laser employee who had met
with me virtually to help me with my dissertation.  It was a real eye opening experience.  For one, I was able to meet in person some of the people behind
companies like Edmund Optics, Hamamatsu, and Andor Technologies and can associate these companies with more than just their websites and sales and customer
support interactions.  I was able to learn about unfamiliar companies and how they have applied optics to various purposes like constructing railroads and
military weapons calibration.  It was also interesting to hear the stories about certain companies, like how Point Grey, the original manufacturer of the Blackfly
and Chameleon cameras used in my research, was bought by Teledyne FLIR, and some of the original members of Point Grey had spun off a new company called Lucid
Vision, which now has GenICam cameras offered on Edmund Optics alongside FLIR, Basler, Allied Vision, and others.  The funnest part of the conference was
attending the AR/VR/MR expo that ran alongside the Photonics West conference, where I got to demo various XR headsets and a fascinating neural-sensing controller
made by Wearable Devices Ltd.

Traveling to this conference was also an opportunity to explore San Francisco.  During my last day there, I rented an electric bike and rode from the city center
over the Golden Gate bridge to Sausalito, and from there took a ferry back to the city.  It was a marvelous experience.  Even though the city is experiencing
decay and homelessness that I saw for myself on top of its reputation, San Francisco is still a beautiful place.  I reflected on how there exists this place in
the world that carries this culture of tech entrepreneurship that defines the city's identity, the same way Las Vegas is by its casinos or New York by Wall Street.
Except unlike gambling or stock investing, I find tech entrepreneurship to be the most admirable of the three industries.

This conference would also be, for the first time, one that I would attend for myself and not because I was obligated to as part of my research
responsibilities.  The cost would be that I would pay for the travel and lodging myself, instead of having the University reimburse these costs, which would
have required justification specifically for how it benefits the University.  As a result of being free of these burdens, I was able to thoroughly enjoy my
time at this conference.
