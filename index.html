<h3>Academic Research Background</h3>

<p>I graduated in 2023 with a PhD in Chemical Physics from the University of Maryland - College Park, where I
conducted research on ultraintense short pulsed lasers, specifically investigating a method to measure the intensity at the focus of the laser 
by analyzing Thomson scattered light produced by the laser when it interacts with electrons ionized from a gas.
</p>

<p>
Presentations I have given:
<ul>
	<li>two talks at the APS DAMOP Conference</li>
	<li>a student seminar at the University of Maryland</li>
	<li>candidacy talk</li>
	<li>thesis defense</li>
</ul>

<p>
I have had the priviledge during my graduate research to work with a spectrometer with gated 
intensified CCD camera and a streak camera for measuring light at the nanosecond and sub-nanosecond time scale.
When I was an undergraduate at UCLA, I developed graphics user interfaces (GUIs) using Python (PyQt, LabRAD) for
computer control of scientific instruments through GPIB and serial ports.
