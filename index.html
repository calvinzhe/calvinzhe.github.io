	<h2>Hi there,</h2>
</div><!-- /.blurb -->

<br>
<br>
<p>I am a graduate student at the University of Maryland - College Park in the Department of Chemical Physics.  I graduated with a B.S. in Physics (and Minor in Math) from UCLA in 2016.  This is my personal website, dedicated to my graduate work and side projects.</p>

<p>My primary research interests are in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Experimental Physics, Quantum Optics, and Nonlinear Optics.  I want to better understand light-matter interaction at the fundamental level, and gain as much technical and professional skills as I can along the way, which will likely include electronics, programming, data analysis, teaching, presentation, and technical writing and reading.  My secondary research interests are in Plasma Physics and Accelerator Physics.</p>

<p>Outside of academia, I like to swim/bike/run/calisthenics, participate in the Army Reserves as a signal sergeant, and would like to become a ham radio hobbyist.</p>
