	<h2>Hi there,</h2>
</div><!-- /.blurb -->

<br>
<br>
<p>I am a graduate student at the University of Maryland - College Park in the Department of Chemical Physics.
I graduated with a B.S. in Physics (and Minor in Math) from UCLA in 2016.
This is my personal website, dedicated to my graduate work and side projects.</p>

<p>My primary research interests are in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Experimental Physics, Quantum Optics, and Nonlinear Optics.
I want to better understand light-matter interaction at the fundamental level, and gain as much technical and professional skills
as I can along the way, which will likely include electronics, programming, data analysis, teaching, presentation, and technical
writing and reading.  My secondary research interests are in Plasma Physics and Accelerator Physics.</p>

<p>My current research is in the area of ultrashort pulse laser interaction with matter.  My recent projects are collaborations with
researchers from the University of Alberta as well as the Centro de Láseres Pulsados (CLPU) Petawatt laser facility in Salamanca, Spain.
The projects involve developing techniques to both measure the intensity of ultraintense lasers at the focus as well as the pressure
of a high vacuum, using Relativistic Thomson Scattered light emitted by the laser interacting with molecules in gas jets and the residual gas
in high vacuum.  A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.27.030020">paper</a> had recently been published in Optics Express on the experiment
 done during the Summer of 2018 at CLPU.
</p>

<p>Outside of academia, I like to swim/bike/run/calisthenics.  I used to be a signal sergeant in the Army Reserves and am interested in
 becoming a ham radio hobbyist.</p>
